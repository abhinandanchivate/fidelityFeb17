ng new client
ng : angular cli
new : new project creation
client : project name 
we typed y for routing
we selected css for formatting html part
use cd to go inside the angular project
for ex. cd client

ng serve (command used to start the angular application)

MEAN stack based 
Mongodb db 
Express writing rest apis
Angular used to develop UI
Node is used as a platform .

we will keep our server and client together (in a single folder).

mostly client is your UI based application.

devtool server(angular part)
ng serve( it will start your devtool server & run the appln . ) when we will say it is going to start
devtool server means when we will do any change into our aplin then immediately it will be rendered over the UI.

module.ts its a module . it wil hold meta data about the module.  list of components, list of other modules which are used in our application, it will hold list of services.
etc.
app module(root module application).



core module 
dashboard module : /dashboard
profile module  : /profile

types of components : 

1. smart component

it means usage of services(a common business logic , REST API call).

2. dump component  : more dumb components , bcoz of reusbality.

how to create a component : 

1. inside the app module 
ng g c componentname 

2. in other modules (except app module)
ng g c module/componentname 
ng : angular 
g : generate
